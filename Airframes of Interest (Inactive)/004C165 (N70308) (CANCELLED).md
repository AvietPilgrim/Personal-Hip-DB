## Airframe History
*No information beyond FAA registry data*

*Notes:*
- Based on the table of Mi-8/17 export numbers, courtesy of [helicopter-database.de](https://www.helicopter-database.de/mi8-export-numbers.php), it is likely that, 004C165 was at some point intended to be exported to Afghanistan, considering the first three digits of the s/n corresponding to the country code (004) for Afghanistan.
- As well, given the presence of the letter C in the s/n, it can be deduced that 196C01 was produced as a "Salon" variant dedicated to passenger service, rather than the standard transport variant that instead has an M in the s/n.
