*Notes:*
- Based on the table of Mi-8/17 export numbers, courtesy of [helicopter-database.de](https://www.helicopter-database.de/mi8-export-numbers.php), it is likely that 004M160 was at some point intended to be exported to Afghanistan on account of the 3-digit country code (004) corresponding to Afghanistan.
