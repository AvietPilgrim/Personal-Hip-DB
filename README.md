This is intended to be a personal database for mainly Mi-8/17 type airframes that are of interest to me, largely those operated by US Agencies / Contractors.
It is being written in markdown using Obsidian and is optimised for viewing as such.
The current scope of the database is simply to consolidate information from various sites to have registration information / history, tracking history and photographs for each airframe all in one place.
If you have suggestions or information regarding certain airframes please contact me on Discord (rooterzooter) via either DM, or in #roots-mi17-workroom in the Project Owl Discord server.
