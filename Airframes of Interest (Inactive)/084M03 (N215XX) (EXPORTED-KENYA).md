*Notes:*
- Based on the table of Mi-8/17 export numbers, courtesy of [helicopter-database.de](https://www.helicopter-database.de/mi8-export-numbers.php), it can be confirmed that 084M01 was first exported to Canada. This is likely linked to the sightings of airframes within this c/n block (084M01, 084M02 and 084M03) at Kelowna Flightcraft, Canada.
