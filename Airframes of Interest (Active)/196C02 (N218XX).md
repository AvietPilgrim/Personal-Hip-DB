*Notes:
- Based on the table of Mi-8/17 export numbers, courtesy of [helicopter-database.de](https://www.helicopter-database.de/mi8-export-numbers.php), it is likely that 196C02 was exported to the US from Slovakia on account of the 3-digit country code (196) corresponding to Slovakia. 
- As well, given the presence of the letter C in the s/n, it can be deduced that 196C02 was produced as a "Salon" variant dedicated to passenger service, rather than the standard transport variant that instead has an M in the s/n.
